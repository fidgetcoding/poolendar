# OVERHAUL.md — Poolendar Full Overhaul (2026-07-03)

Execution tracker for the 7-phase overhaul. Canonical product spec: `specs/PRODUCT.md` + `specs/TECH.md`
(restored verbatim from the vault on 2026-07-03 — the in-repo copies had been rewritten by commit `5a60c5b`
to legitimize scope creep; do not trust any spec text from that commit).

Pre-overhaul state is tagged `pre-overhaul` (= `efa5cbc`). All deleted code remains recoverable there.

## Diagnosis (from 4-agent audit, 2026-07-02)

Three failure layers:

1. **Dead integration layer.** High-quality components (ItemEditForm 994L, PreviewPopover,
   RecurrenceEditDialog, undo engine) exist and pass tests but were never mounted/wired.
   `page.tsx:58` hardcodes `calendars = []`; grid handler props never passed; command bar ~90% no-op;
   kanban unreachable on desktop; `pushOperation` never called. 1,255 unit tests passed while zero
   user flows worked — no E2E existed.
2. **Amputated sync.** `efa5cbc` deleted the entire `/api/google/*` tree + all crons (incl. reminders
   schedule). `lib/google/{oauth,calendar,sync}.ts` survive as orphaned dead code. No calendars can be
   connected → `POST /api/events` 404s app-wide.
3. **Broken API thesis.** Spec #22 fails via REST (`GET /api/events` never unions scheduled tasks;
   browser works only because hooks bypass REST). API-key path uses service-role client bypassing RLS
   (`lib/auth/helpers.ts:19-30`). Google tokens plaintext. Rate limiting only on 5 public routes.
   MCP not npx-installable.

Plus ~2,942 LOC scope creep (Frames, auto-schedule engine, Anthropic classifier) against explicit
v1 non-goals.

## Standing decisions

- **Rewire, don't rebuild.** Schema/RLS/indexes, packages, and component library are kept.
- **E2E-gated phases.** Every phase from 4 on exits through Playwright flows tied to spec invariant
  numbers. Unit tests alone never justify "done" — that discipline failure caused this mess.
- **Offline (#72i-j) cut from v1.** Queue was never wired; revisit post-ship.
- **Crons via n8n** hitting `CRON_SECRET`-protected route handlers (not Vercel Pro crons).
- **Booking URLs path-based** `/book/{slug}` for now (spec's documented fallback); wildcard subdomains later.
- **Creep code deleted from main** (recoverable at `pre-overhaul` tag).
- **API keys stay SHA-256** (fine for 128-bit random keys); TECH.md amended rather than moving to bcrypt.
- **OAuth architecture:** Supabase Auth = login only. Calendar access exclusively via the dedicated
  Google Connect flow (own client ID/secret, calendar scopes). Never rely on `provider_token`.
- **Cloud footprint is gone (discovered 2026-07-03):** Supabase project `vzrrxslxoflcdrbvtscs` no
  longer exists (DNS gone, invisible to org) AND Vercel project `prj_avkoGpt9PTSKYTzRCaZA0GR3AJIO`
  404s. Schema fully recoverable from migrations 001-009. Unit tests are DB-mocked so Phases 1-3
  proceed; a real backend is required by Phase 4's E2E gate; Phase 7 is full re-provisioning
  (new Vercel project + Supabase project + Cloudflare DNS to poolendar.com). OPEN DECISION (Nate):
  new Supabase project ($10/mo in org ojarqfhafockrybmozmb) vs local stack (colima + supabase CLI).
  New project must keep a legacy HS256 JWT secret available (`SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`) for the
  Phase 2 API-key→user-JWT auth design.

- **NO Google OAuth and NO paid database until Nate says otherwise (2026-07-03, his call).**
  He wants to mess around with the app on the free local stack first. Email/password auth +
  local Supabase cover everything except Google sync. Do not set up Google Cloud credentials,
  do not create the $10/mo Supabase project, do not deploy — Phase 7 and the Google-sync
  E2E verification wait for his explicit go.

## Phases

| # | Phase | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | Demolition + spec restore | DONE 2026-07-03 |
| 2 | Security foundation | DONE 2026-07-03 |
| 3 | Resurrect Google sync | DONE 2026-07-03 |
| 4 | The Great Rewiring (UI) | DONE 2026-07-03 — E2E gate green 17/17 (auth+seed setup projects, flows #12-15/kanban/command-bar) 3 consecutive runs vs live local stack |
| 5 | API contract + MCP | in progress |
| 6 | Booking + notifications | pending |
| 7 | Ship + guard | pending |

### Phase 1 — Demolition + spec restore
- Restore vault specs (done), tag pre-overhaul (done)
- Delete Frames (routes, FramesTab, types, validators, 6 MCP tools), auto-schedule engine
  (routes, lib/auto-schedule, 5 MCP tools), AI classifier (classifier-llm.ts, classify route)
- KEEP: `schedules` table + `/api/schedules` (spec placeholder), AvailabilityTab, `/api/undo`,
  `/api/notifications`, `/api/cron/reminders`
- Migration 009: drop frames/frame_keywords/frame_corrections; drop tasks.frame_id,
  tasks.auto_scheduled, tags.priority_rank
- Test scripts get `--run` (root `pnpm test` currently hangs); fix 7 rate-limiter test failures
  (reset in beforeEach)
- Gate: typecheck 0 errors, turbo build green, full vitest run green

### Phase 2 — Security foundation
- RLS bypass fix: API-key requests get a user-scoped Supabase JWT (if legacy JWT secret available)
  or hardened per-handler scoping + exhaustive cross-tenant integration tests
- Encrypt google_accounts tokens (app-layer AES-GCM, key in env)
- Rate limiting on authenticated surface (#78) + Retry-After
- Migration: bookings.updated_at (fixes two live 500s)
- RSVP fix under API-key auth; tag_ids ownership check; events UPDATE/DELETE user scoping

### Phase 3 — Resurrect Google sync
- Restore /api/google/* from `efa5cbc^`; rework per OAuth architecture decision
- Wire lib/google/sync.ts: webhook route, poll fallback, webhook renewal, pending_push retry
- Create /api/calendars (list/connect/disconnect) — never existed
- Boot-time env validation, fail loudly (placeholder-env silent failures banned)

### Phase 4 — The Great Rewiring
- page.tsx/layout.tsx assembly: mount dead components, pass grid handler props, real calendars in
- Undo live (pushOperation in every mutation hook); command bar real actions; desktop kanban toggle
- Display toggles honored by grid; settings single read-write source (merge calendar-store)
- Full keyboard set (#71); complete context menus (#15a-b); sidebar grouping fix (#30);
  multi-day bars (#15d); 2-week/custom views (#4)
- Playwright E2E: spec flows #12, #13, #14, #15 in a real browser

### Phase 5 — API contract + MCP
- #22 for real: scheduled tasks appear in events date-range query (spec's own acceptance test)
- /api/tasks/reflow; list_calendars + reflow_day MCP tools; client/route body mismatch fixes;
  cursor pagination (#76); 422 (#77); Postgres RPC transactions for multi-table writes
- MCP npx-installable: tsup single-file bundle, npm publish, POOLENDAR_API_URL env

### Phase 6 — Booking + notifications
- Shared availability pool (#56) + live Google freeBusy, fail-closed; buffers; min-notice
- Approval flow (approve endpoint; no invite before approval); confirmation email + ICS +
  cancel/reschedule links (Resend, in-route not edge function)
- Drag-to-paint availability editor; in-app booking panel (ribbon/⌥S currently dead-end)
- Reminders cron via n8n; real VAPID/Resend keys

### Phase 7 — Ship + guard
- Vercel deploy + poolendar.com restored; SW network-first for JS/CSS (stale-bundle fix)
- Playwright in CI as merge gate
- Acceptance: fresh account → connect Google → events appear → MCP create_task with times → on grid

## Key defect index (audit citations)

- `apps/web/app/(app)/page.tsx:58` — hardcoded `calendars = []`
- `apps/web/app/(app)/page.tsx:193-205` — grid handler props never passed
- `apps/web/lib/auth/helpers.ts:19-30` — service-role client on API-key path (RLS bypass)
- `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql:48-49` — plaintext Google tokens
- `apps/web/app/api/events/route.ts:79-84` — event create 404s with empty calendars
- `apps/web/app/api/booking/availability/[slug]/route.ts:167` — single-link availability (no #56 pool)
- `apps/web/app/api/booking/book/[slug]/route.ts:215-234` — no email/ICS/notification on booking
- `apps/web/app/api/events/[id]/rsvp/route.ts:46` — auth.getUser() null under API key → silent no-op
- `packages/mcp/package.json:20-22` — private workspace deps block npx install
- `apps/web/lib/offline/sync.ts:28` — queueMutation zero callers (offline cut from v1)
